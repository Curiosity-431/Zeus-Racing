	<p align="center">Formula Student is an international design based competition for engineering students. It is held in various parts of the world and teams from all over the world compete in these events.</p>
	<br><br>
	
	<p align="center">Students build a single seat formula race car. The competition is not won solely by the team with the fastest car, but rather by the team with the best overall package of construction, performance, cost and sales planning. This competition challenges the team members to go the extra step in their education by incorporating into its intensive experience in building and manufacturing as well as considering the economic aspects of the automotive industry. </p><br><br>
	
	<p align="center">Teams take on this project on the assumptions that they are a manufacturer developing the prototype to be evaluated for production. The target audience is the non-professional weekend racer. The car should have good driving characteristics like acceleration, braking and handling. It should be offered at a reasonable cost, dependable and reliable. Additionally, the car's market value increases through other factors such as asthetics, comfort, use of readily available and standard purchase components.  </p> <br><br>
	
	<p align="center">This isn't solely an engineering based event, because there are other factors to consider, like the labour of the manufacturing processes, the business viablity of the product i.e. the race car, the finance that goes into the cars production and all management that goes with it, and finally the on road performance of the car on the track which is via the driving skills of the driver, making it an overall development experience rather than just an academic experience.</p><br><br>
	
	<p align="center">The jury will judge every team's car and sales plan based on construction, cost planning and sales presentation, as well as the car's performance on the track.</p></strong></div><br><br><br><br>
