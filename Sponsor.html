	<div class="center">
	<p id="text">Zeus Racing India is a Formula Bharat team of PSG College of technology, Coimbatore. The team is formed by 45 students from various departments like Robotics and Automation, Mechanical, Automobile and ECE to prove what engineering students are capable of at the undergraduate level. Being the admirers of motorsports, we have taken up the task of designing a car on our own. Our college already has a team called pegasus which makes combustion cars for the Formula Bharat event. So here we are to make an electric car for the very first time in our locality. Our professional skills are being developed by consistent lab hours. However, there still prevails a further requirement of monetary, technical and other means of support from the industry.Sponserships from renowned organisations such as yours, are of great help and importance for assisting the team in such prominent global events.Hence,I seek your altruistic support so that the team may achieve its goal and make our country stand with pride. </p></div>
